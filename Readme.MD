# üß† Loan Application Processing System using OpenAI Agent SDK

This project implements a modular, intelligent agent pipeline to automate loan application decision-making. Built with OpenAI's Agent SDK and powered by deterministic tools, it evaluates compliance (SLA), detects fraud, validates audit trails, explains decisions, and dispatches final reports using MCP-integrated channels (e.g., Slack, Zapier). A Streamlit UI enables CSV-based batch processing and summary review.

The decision logic is fully configurable via a JSON matrix, allowing you to tune how SLA, fraud, and affordability results determine the final recommendation.
---

## ‚ùó Problem Statement

There is a backlog of loan applications that are currently manually checked, and this is slowing down the loan approval process.

## üí° Proposed Solution

To create an agent workflow that will process loan applications agentically and autonomously.
---

## üìã Setup & Run Instructions

### ‚úÖ Quick Start

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd loan_decision_pipeline
cp .env.example .env  # Add your keys here
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è CLI Usage
```bash
python eval_runner.py     # Runs full pipeline on all records in CSV
python main_runner.py     # Tests single application (optionally sends to MCP)
```

### üñ• Run the Streamlit UI
```bash
streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py
```
Then open your browser to: http://localhost:8501

Upload `loan_applications_large.csv` or similar to process and view summaries.

---

## ‚úÖ Use Case

Monitor the journey from loan application submission to approval/rejection. The system:
- Detects SLA violations
- Flags fraud risk
- Validates step-wise process compliance
- Explains decisions
- Sends summaries to relevant stakeholders

---

## üìã User Stories

### 1. **Loan Officer ‚Äì SLA Monitoring**
> "As a loan officer, I want to be notified if any loan processing step exceeds the SLA limit so I can take action."

### 2. **Risk Analyst ‚Äì Fraud Pattern Detection**
> "As a risk analyst, I want to know if the application matches known fraud signals to intervene early."

### 3. **Compliance Manager ‚Äì Audit Trail Check**
> "As a compliance officer, I need to ensure that loan steps follow a valid, sequential flow."

### 4. **Business Lead ‚Äì Summary & Insights**
> "As a business lead, I want to receive clear summaries of loan processing outputs and their explanations."

## üåü Test Criteria

| Metric         | Description                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Completeness** | Each user story has functional logic mapped in code          |
| **Validity**     | Output reflects realistic data, behavior, and edge cases     |
| **Coverage**     | Handles delays, no-fraud, fraud, sequence errors, etc.       |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Requirements

### ‚úÖ Technologies Used
- **OpenAI Agent SDK**: For building deterministic function-calling agents
- **Function Tools**: Logic-bound utilities called by agents
- **Multichannel Plugin (MCP)**: Sends final output via external systems (Zapier, Slack, etc.)
- **Streamlit**: For interactive UI to upload, process, and view summaries
- **Python 3.10+**, `aiohttp`, `pandas`, `dotenv`, `streamlit`

---

## üßπ How It Works ‚Äì End-to-End Flow

1. **Input**: Loan applications (from CSV/json)
2. **Context Prep**: Convert record into `LoanApplicationJourney` dataclass
3. **Tool Execution via Orchestration**:
   - `check_sla()` ‚Üí SLA compliance
   - `check_fraud()` ‚Üí fraud signal check
   - `check_audit_trail()` ‚Üí event sequencing validation
   - `explain_decision()` ‚Üí justification summary
   - `synthesize_summary()` ‚Üí final report format
4. **Orchestration is managed by `orchestrate_application()`** in `orchestrator_pipeline.py`
5. **UI** is implemented in Streamlit (`streamlit_app.py`) and prints summaries
6. **ReportAgent** optionally sends the result via MCP

## üß† Why OpenAI Agent SDK?

This project uses deterministic agents built on OpenAI's Agent SDK:
- **Function Tools**: Logic tools exposed via decorators to agents
- **Context Objects**: Rich data models (e.g. `LoanApplicationJourney`) for structured reasoning
- **Orchestration**: Deterministic execution handled via an explicit orchestration function (`orchestrate_application()`), improving clarity and modularity over `Runner.run()` abstraction.

This ensures **predictability**, **auditability**, and easy integration with external systems (via MCP).

## üìê Architecture Refactor Roadmap

To evolve this project into a scalable, production-grade, multi-agent orchestration platform, the following architecture and design enhancements are proposed:

### üîÅ Multi-Agent Extensibility

- Design a centralized `agent_registry.py` to define:
  - Agent name (e.g., "secured_lending", "mortgage_lending")
  - Associated orchestration logic (e.g., `orchestrate_secured()`)
  - Routing type: `"deterministic"`, `"mcp"`, or `"gpt"`-driven
- Allow new agents to be added by appending a single entry to the registry

### üåê MCP Service Expansion

- Create MCP Server variants per agent type:
  - `SecuredLoanMCP`, `MortgageLoanMCP`, etc.
- Each agent can optionally use:
  - Deterministic tool
  - External data (credit bureau, valuation APIs) via MCP
- Support toggle per environment via `.env` or config flag

### üè∑Ô∏è Lending Type Enrichment

- Refactor input data model (`LoanApplicationJourney`) to include:
  - `loan_type`: one of `["overdraft", "personal_loan", "credit_card", "car_loan", "mortgage"]`
- Update `orchestrator_pipeline` to route logic by loan type

### üîå Tool-as-API Pattern

- Refactor tools to be exposed as lightweight REST APIs
- Agents call tools via HTTP (use `aiohttp` client)
- Benefits:
  - Improves isolation and debugging
  - Enables microservice deployment
  - Allows horizontal scaling

### üì° Orchestration State Exposure

- Provide orchestration logs/status via API endpoint
- Track tool calls, inputs, outputs, and decisions
- Allow front end to poll/report orchestration journey

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Scalable Infrastructure Design

- Define container strategy (Docker)
  - One container per agent
  - One container per tool
- Optional: use Kubernetes for orchestration
- Optional: use Redis/pubsub for async tool messaging

### üßë‚Äçüíº Multi-User Experience

- Define user roles:
  - Loan applicant: submits one record
  - Loan processor: sees queue of loans to evaluate
- Split UI into:
  - Application portal (submission)
  - Underwriter dashboard (streamlit or Flask)
- Use session state to manage user role and views
