    "# Deterministic Agent Workflow for Financial Services - Loan Application Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a complete **deterministic agent pipeline** for automating a loan application decision process proposed by Team 5 (Full Code) as part of the **Oxford Artificial Intelligence Summit 2025: Autonomous AI Agents** capstone project. The workflow runs a fixed sequence of agent tools and combines their results into a final summary, which is then emailed using a Zapier workflow and MCP integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "A deterministic workflow was chosen for this project to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and ease of auditing in the loan decision process. By following a clearly defined sequence of steps, the workflow guarantees that every application is evaluated consistently according to the same business rules, making it ideal for regulated environments where explainability and compliance are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main sections of this notebook are: \n",
    "1. **Deterministic Workflow** — simple baseline flow with hardcoded loan application data\n",
    "2. **Enhanced Flow** — calls the Zapier MCP server for composing and emailing the final recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each stage includes **code, agent tool calls, and clear markdown explanations** to guide you through the deterministic process.\n",
    "\n",
